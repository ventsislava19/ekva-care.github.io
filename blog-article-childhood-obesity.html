                <h2 class="text-brown fs-450 ff-serif uppercase letter-spacing-2">The growing impact of childhood obesity <br> and food advertising</h2>

                <p class="indented">Globally, childhood obesity rates have surged, increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases early in life, which can lead to long-term health complications. Obesity is a complex, multifactorial issue influenced by genetic predisposition, reduced physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns and other factors. The widespread advertising of unhealthy foods aimed at children is often regarded as a major contributing factor to this multifaceted issue.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text-brown ff-serif main-part--blog-template flow">

                <h1 class="fancy-underline text-brown fs-350 ff-serif uppercase letter-spacing-2">How advertising shapes children's food choices</h1>

                <p class="indented">Advertisements have a profound impact on children's taste preferences and eating habits from an early age, shaping long-lasting behavioural patterns. Psychological and neurological studies clearly show that children who are frequently exposed to ads for high-calorie, low-nutrient products develop a preference for these foods and are much less likely to choose healthier options. Watching these ads also increases their desire for unhealthy foods, even when they are not hungry.</p>

                <p class="indented">Through psychological strategies, advertisements create deep associations between fun, reward, and the consumption of sugary and fatty foods, hindering the perception of food as a source of essential nutrients for health and energy.</p>

                <p class="indented">Food plays both a physiological and emotional role in our lives, providing energy and pleasure. However, when the focus is primarily on the emotional aspect, especially from a very young age, it can lead to nutritional imbalances and, in the long term, contribute to obesity and an increased risk of chronic diseases.</p>


                <h1 class=" fancy-underline text-brown fs-350 ff-serif uppercase letter-spacing-2">Health risks of unhealthy eating</h1>

                <p class="indented">It is important to emphasise that food is not strictly 'good' or 'bad'. Healthy food is rich in nutrients and supports the body, while unhealthy food is less nutritionally dense but should not be demonised. In moderation and within a balanced diet, unhealthy foods can play a role in our lives without causing harm, as long as our body consistently receives all the nutrients it needs to function. Establishing balance is key to good health. When this balance is disrupted by excessive consumption of processed foods, it can lead to health risks such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Disrupted metabolism: For example, chronic high sugar intake burdens the pancreas, increasing the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes.</li>
                    <li>Increased risk of cardiovascular diseases: Consumption of saturated and trans fats contributes to high cholesterol levels, challenging the optimal functioning of the cardiovascular system.</li>
                    <li>Micronutrient deficiencies: Replacing nutritious foods in the diet reduces the intake of fibre, vitamins, and minerals, which are essential for our health and function.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1 class="fancy-underline text-brown fs-350 ff-serif uppercase letter-spacing-2">Commonly marketed foods and healthier alternatives</h1>

                <p class="indented">Several categories of foods that are commonly marketed with a focus on younger audiences include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sugary breakfast cereals - These are often chosen for breakfast or snacks. They are typically marketed as quick and tasty options but often contain large amounts of added sugars and few nutrients.</li>
                    <p class="letter-spacing-4">ü´ê <span class="highlight-round-edges">Dietitian's tip: Choose cereals that are high in fibre and low in sugar.</span></p>
                    <li>Fast foods - Such as hamburgers, pizzas, and fried foods near/in schools. These foods are typically high in saturated fats, salt, and calories, providing few beneficial nutrients.</li>
                    <p class="letter-spacing-4">ü´ê <span class="highlight-round-edges">Dietitian's tip: Take time to prepare meals at home, involving your child in the selection of food and cooking process. This may require patience and effort from your side, but it is an important investment not only for your child's nutrition but also for building lasting healthy habits.</span></p>
                    <li>Sweet snacks and sugary drinks - Such as biscuits, wafers, ice cream, and soft drinks with high sugar content. These foods and drinks are often marketed with bright packaging and attractive images that appeal to children.</li>
                    <p class="letter-spacing-4">ü´ê <span class="highlight-round-edges">Dietitian's tip: Choose and offer more nutritious alternatives at home. For example, homemade ice cream with fresh fruit or homemade energy bars with oats, honey, and nuts.</span></p>
                </ul>

                <h1 class="fancy-underline text-brown fs-350 ff-serif uppercase letter-spacing-2">New UK legislation: A step toward tackling childhood obesity</h1>

                <p class="indented">The UK is taking a significant step in the fight against childhood obesity by introducing new legislation that bans advertisements for junk foods on television and online platforms before 9pm. This decision is part of the country's broader efforts to address the growing levels of obesity among children.</p>

                <p class="indented">It is expected that reducing ads for junk food will lead to a significant decline in the consumption of products high in sugar, salt, and saturated fats. Additionally, limiting the influence of advertising may encourage parents to make healthier food choices without being subjected to constant pressure from external sources.</p>

                <h1 class="fancy-underline text-brown fs-350 ff-serif uppercase letter-spacing-2">Is this regulation enough?</h1>

                <p class="indented">Although the new law is an important step, it is not sufficient on its own to solve the issue of childhood obesity. The multifaceted nature of this problem requires a combination of different approaches, including health policies, educational programs, and changes in social conditions.</p>

                <p class="indented">Regulations aimed at limiting the advertising of unhealthy foods to children can help address the problem. The UK will serve as an important example for other countries and will provide valuable data on the effectiveness of these policies.</p>
